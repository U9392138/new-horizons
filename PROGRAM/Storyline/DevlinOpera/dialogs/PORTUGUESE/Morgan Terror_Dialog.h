"Good Day to you Captain",
"Good Day to you too, Sir",
"I send messages you know.",
"Oh really?",
"Yes, lots of them.",
"Yes, lots and lots of them.",
"So, if you ever want a message sent, you know who to ask.",
"Thank you. I'll remember that.",
"Did I mention that I'm good at sending messages?", 
"Well, er.. Yes, I think you did.",
"Because, if you wanted, I could send a message on to your brother, so he would be expecting you, and that would make your task a lot easier.",
"Hmmm! And what would this 'message' cost me to send?",
"Oh! A special rate for you, captain. 100 pieces of gold.",
"That seems like a lot, but I suppose it would be worth it in the time it will save.",
"No, I think I'll just find him myself, thank you.",
"I don't have that much gold on me, so I can't take up your offer. Goodbye.",
